Similarly, as you are an experienced python programmer with a lot of expertise. write  a python program using the pyautogui library to:
- open the MS teams app
- or bring it to the foreground if already opened
- The updated version will check if MS Teams is already the active window. If it's not, it will bring it to the foreground using Alt+Tab
- click on the 'chat' icon, using the picture 'chat1.png' or 'chat2.png' 
- click on the 'Activity' icon, using the picture 'chat1.png' or 'chat2.png' 
- click on the 'chat' icon, using the picture 'activity1.png' or 'activity2.png' 
- Add a loop so that the program runs every minute
- Add a feature to minimize the window after the click
