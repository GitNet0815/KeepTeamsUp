Similarly, as you are an experienced python programmer with a lot of expertise. write  a python program using the pyautogui library to:
- open the MS teams app
- or bring it to the foreground if already opened
- The updated version will check if MS Teams is already the active window. If it's not, it will bring it to the foreground using Alt+Tab
- click on the 'chat' icon, using the picture 'chat1.png' or 'chat2.png' 
- click on the 'Activity' icon, using the picture 'chat1.png' or 'chat2.png' 
- click on the 'chat' icon, using the picture 'activity1.png' or 'activity2.png' 
- Add a loop so that the program runs every minute
- Add a feature to minimize the window after the click

- add a tray icon with menu top start/stop/quit
- split in 2 libraries
- asynchronous function call using the asyncio library
- Maintains a flag (is_loop_running) to check whether the loop is running.
- Creates the Menu Dynamically: When the loop state changes, updates the menu to add or remove the checkmark.
- The tray is started in a separate thread (tray_thread) so that it runs concurrently with the loop.
